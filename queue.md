# Queues-Linear-and-Circular-

Aim : Program to implement queue operations to add and delete data in a queue.

Description : 
        A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, 
        where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.
        Queue follows the First In First Out(FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first too.
       
        Queue insertion/deletion function:-
          Enqueue: Add element to end of queue
          Dequeue: Remove element from front of queue
        
        Two types of queue :-
          1. Linear Queue : It is a linear data structure. It is considered as sequence of items. 
                Once queue becomes full, we can not insert the next element even if there is a space in front of queue.
          
          2. Circular Queue : Circular Queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on 
              FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. 
              It is also called ‘Ring Buffer’.
              In a normal Queue, we can insert elements until queue becomes full. 
              But once queue becomes full, we can not insert the next element even if there is a space in front of queue.
